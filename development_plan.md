# Development Plan

## Overview

This development plan breaks down the deliverables and timeline into functional chunks, each with clear exit criteria to ensure progress is measurable and aligned with the project goals. The focus is on delivering a functional web application prototype that can be hosted or recorded for a demo walkthrough.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for handling API requests
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API) for storing data.
- **Hosting**: Use Azure services (Static Web Apps and App Service) for both frontend and backend hosting.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for managing the project code
- **Testing**: Focus on manual testing, with optional integration of Azure Test Plans for tracking and managing test cases.

## Functional Chunks and Timeline

### Day 1: Project Setup
- **Tasks**:
  - Create the GitHub repository and initialize the project.
  - Configure the development environment (Node.js, React, Azure Cosmos DB).
  - Scaffold the project structure (frontend, backend, and database setup).
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - Repository is created and accessible.
  - Development environment is fully configured and operational.
  - Basic project structure is in place with placeholder files for frontend, backend, and database.

---

### Day 2: Reading Journey Tracking
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement backend API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) reading records.
  - Create a frontend form for users to log their reading journeys (books, articles, audiobooks, work documents).
  - Connect the frontend to the backend API.
  - Deploy the backend to Azure App Service and the frontend to Azure Static Web Apps.
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - Users can log and view their reading journeys via the frontend.
  - Data is successfully stored in Azure Cosmos DB and retrieved through the API.
  - Frontend and backend are deployed and accessible via Azure services.

---

### Day 3: Reviews and Reading List
- **Tasks**:
  - Add backend support for user reviews and a "to-read" list.
  - Create frontend components for adding reviews and managing the reading list.
  - Ensure data validation and error handling for user inputs.
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - Users can add reviews to their reading records.
  - Users can maintain a "to-read" list and view it on the frontend.
  - All data is stored and retrieved correctly from Azure Cosmos DB.

---

### Day 4: Search and Organization
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a basic search feature on the backend (e.g., by title, author, or format).
  - Create a frontend search bar and display results dynamically.
  - Add basic sorting and filtering options for reading records.
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - Users can search for reading records by title, author, or format.
  - Users can sort and filter their reading records on the frontend.

---

### Day 5: Internal Testing and Visual Design
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct internal testing of all implemented features to identify and fix bugs.
  - Begin creating visual designs for the interface, focusing on a clean and intuitive user experience.
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - All MVP features are tested and functional without major bugs.
  - Initial visual designs are created and integrated into the frontend.

---

### Day 6: Finalize Visual Design and UI Refinements
- **Tasks**:
  - Refine the user interface based on feedback and testing results.
  - Ensure the design is responsive and accessible across devices.
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - The interface is visually polished, responsive, and user-friendly.
  - All design elements align with the project goals.

---

### Day 7: End-to-End Testing
- **Tasks**:
  - Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of the platform.
  - Address any remaining issues or bugs.
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - The platform passes all end-to-end tests.
  - No critical bugs remain.

---

### Day 8: Delivery and Demo Preparation
- **Tasks**:
  - Prepare the platform for hosting (deploy to Azure services).
  - Record a demo walkthrough showcasing the platform's functionality.
  - Finalize and deliver all documentation.
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - The platform is hosted and accessible online.
  - A demo walkthrough video is recorded and ready for presentation.
  - All documentation is complete and delivered.

---

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Delays in feature implementation.
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize MVP features and defer non-essential features to stretch goals.
- **Risk**: Hosting or deployment issues.
  - **Mitigation**: Allocate extra time on Day 8 for deployment and testing in the production environment.
- **Risk**: Insufficient time for testing.
  - **Mitigation**: Dedicate Day 5 and Day 7 specifically for testing and debugging.

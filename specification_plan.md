- Integrate gamification elements such as goals, badges or achievements, to encourage consistent reading.
- Support importing/exporting reading data from/to external platforms or formats.
- Provide personalized recommendations based on users' reading history and preferences.

## Audience

- **Primary Audience**: Internal employees of the Microsoft VS Code team. These users are likely to be tech-savvy individuals who value productivity tools and appreciate features that help them organize and reflect on their reading habits. They may use the platform to track technical documentation, articles, and books relevant to their work.
- **Secondary Audience**: Broader audiences, including avid readers, knowledge workers, and students. These users may have diverse reading preferences and would benefit from features like personalized recommendations, gamification, and community engagement.
- **Needs and Preferences**:
  - A clean, intuitive interface for tracking and organizing reading materials.
  - Advanced search and filtering options for quick access to specific items.
  - Features that foster motivation and engagement, such as progress tracking and achievements.
  - The ability to share and discover reading insights within a community.
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure the platform is accessible and user-friendly for non-technical users.
  - Provide customization options to cater to different reading habits and preferences.
  - Maintain a balance between professional and casual use cases to appeal to a wide audience.

## Deliverables
- A functional prototype of the platform with the following MVP features:
  - Ability to track reading journeys across various formats (books, articles, audiobooks, and work documents).
  - Option for users to add reviews and maintain a list of items they'd like to read in the future.
  - Basic interface for searching and organizing reading records.
- Visual designs for the interface, focusing on a clean and intuitive user experience.

## Timeline
- **May 5 (Day 1)**: Finalize project setup, including repository creation, environment configuration, and initial scaffolding for the platform.
- **May 6 (Day 2)**: Implement the ability to track reading journeys across various formats (books, articles, audiobooks, and work documents).
- **May 7 (Day 3)**: Develop functionality for users to add reviews and maintain a list of items they'd like to read in the future.
- **May 8 (Day 4)**: Build a basic interface for searching and organizing reading records.
- **May 9**: Day off.
- **May 12 (Day 5)**: Conduct internal testing and debugging of MVP features. Begin creating visual designs for the interface.
- **May 13 (Day 6)**: Finalize visual designs and refine the user interface for a clean and intuitive experience.
- **May 14 (Day 7)**: Perform end-to-end testing of the platform and address any remaining issues.
- **May 15 (Day 8)**: Prepare and deliver the functional prototype, along with visual designs and documentation.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Delays in environment setup or initial scaffolding.
  - **Mitigation**: Allocate extra time on Day 1 for setup and ensure all dependencies are pre-installed.
- **Risk**: Difficulty in implementing advanced features like search and organization.
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on delivering a basic implementation first, with room for refinement during testing.
- **Risk**: Insufficient time for testing and debugging.
  - **Mitigation**: Allocate Day 5 and Day 7 specifically for testing and debugging to ensure quality.
- **Risk**: Visual designs taking longer than expected.
  - **Mitigation**: Begin design work in parallel with testing and prioritize essential elements for the MVP.
